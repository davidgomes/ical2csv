### Dependencies:
* ***icalendar***
	*  [**Homepage**](http://icalendar.readthedocs.org/)
	*  [**Code**](http://github.com/collective/icalendar)
    * **Installation**: `pip install icalendar`
* ***BeautifulSoup4*** (pip3 install beautifulsoup4)
* ***recurring-ical-events*** (pip3 install recurring-ical-events)

## Usage of ical2csv

Call the script and pass in the location of the ics file.

Ex: `python ical2csv.py event.ics`

# ical2txt w/sorted events by start date

Like ical2csv.py, it parses an ics file and writes the output to a text-file. This is more of an agenda style.

## Installation of ical2txt
Download the script or clone the project and get it from there.

## Usage of ical2txt

Call the script and pass in the location of the ics file.

Ex: `python ical2txt.py event.ics` / `python3 ical2txt.py event.ics`

Note: You can limit output to a certain time period. Useful for week logs and the like:

`./ical2txt.py myexport.ics 20210101 20211231`

`./ical2txt.py myexport.ics 2021-01-01T00:00:00 2021-01-31T23:59:59`

**NEW AS OF 2021-03-28:** Recurring events are now actually processed in ical2txt.py. If no end date is given 5 years from now is chosen.

**NEW AS OF 2021-05-02:** ical2csv.py update with same features as ical2txt.py, except removing Google/Skype meeting details.
